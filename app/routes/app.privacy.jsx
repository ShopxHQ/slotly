        This Privacy Policy explains how our app (the "App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we operate.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Our App has minimal data collection practices. The App primarily displays information that you voluntarily set within the application itself. We do not actively collect personal information beyond what is necessary for the App to function.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Schedule and timer settings that you configure within the App</li>
        <li>Any preferences or configurations you choose to set</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <li>Provide the core functionality of the App</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is stored securely and is only accessible through your account. We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Your data is kept confidential and used only to provide the App's services.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        The App may use cookies or similar technologies to enhance your user experience and remember your preferences. You can control cookie settings through your browser.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

        You have the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access your data at any time within the App</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your data</li>
        <li>Update or correct your information</li>
